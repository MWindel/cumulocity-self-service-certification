# Information Model of Device Certification Microservice & Application

## Test Suite

The test suite is created by the technical partner management team at Software AG and has a hierarchical structure:

- Tests (e.g. Foundation Modules)
  - Modules (e.g. Device Information)
    - Parts   (e.g. device config text)
      - Capabilities (e.g. c8y_IsDevice)

![model diagram](media/model.drawio.svg)

The test suite data structure is used by the UI to generate the list of to be tested items.

The `c8y_certification_testSuite` object is represented in the following json format:

```json5
{
  type: 'c8y_certification_testSuite', // set by MS: type of the managed object
  version: '1.2',
  tests: [
    {
      id: 'foundationModules',
      title: 'Foundation Modules',
      modules: [
        {
          id: 'deviceInformation',
          title: 'Device Information',
          endpoint: 'deviceInformation',
          mandatory: true, // true, false or obmitted (= false)
          parts:[
            id: 'parts',
            title: 'device parts',
            mandatory: true, // true, false or obmitted (= false)
            capabilities: [
              {
                id: 'c8y_IsDevice',
                title: 'c8y_IsDevice',
                mandatory: true,
              },
            ]
          ]
        },
      ]
    },
  ]
}
```

## Test Run

When the user creates a new `Product`in the UI, a new `c8y_certification_testRun` object is created for this product if there is no entry already.
The test run object is instantiated from the test suite data structure, by adding the `product` fragment and a `status` fragment to each `capability`.

```json5
{
  type: 'c8y_certification_testRun', // set by MS: type of the manged object
  version: '1.2',
  c8y_version: '1010.0.8',
  testSuite: '123456',
  certificate: '234567',
  status: {
    code: 'PENDING',
  },
  hashValue: '2e400e60b947152aec082aadcc1d820a', // set by MS: md5 hash value to make sure only SAG can change this
  product: {
    productName: 'BCM2708 000e', // set by user
    productType: 'Device',
    vendorName: 'Partner Company', // set by user
    deviceId: '9656728', // set by MS: device id taken from the device managed object
    parentId: '9656729', // set by MS: if there is a parent this should be the connection
  },
  deviceInformation: {
    parent: 'foundationModules',
    status: {
      // set by MS: added to indicate the status of each capability
      code: 'FAILED', // set by MS
    },
    parts: {
      parent: 'deviceInformation',
      status: {
        // set by MS: added to indicate the status of each capability
        code: 'FAILED' // set by MS
      },
      mandatory: true, // true, false or obmitted (= false)     
      capabilities: {
        c8y_IsDevice: {
          status: {
            code: 'FAILED',
            text: 'The fragment <code>c8y_IsDevice</code> was not found in the inventory object of the device.', // HTML supported
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Life Cycle of a Test Run

The life cycle of a test run is captured in the status of all tested capabilities. `tests.modules.capabilities.status.code`can have the following values:

| Value         | Meaning                                                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PENDING`     | Test was not executed yes                                                              |
| `EXECUTING`   | Test is currently in execution                                                         |
| `SUCCESSFUL`  | Test executed and returned successful state                                            |
| `FAILED`      | Test executed and returned failed state                                                |
| `UNSUPPORTED` | For optional modules only. Set if device does not indicate to support this capability. |

When a test run object is created, all tests are set to `PENDING` state.
When a test is stated, it sets the respective status to `EXECUTING`.
When a test is finished, it sets the state `SUCCESSFUL` or `FAILED`, together with a descriptive text that helps the user to debug put in the `tests.modules.capabilities.status.text` fragment.

## Test Certificate

When all mandatory test are in `SUCCESSFUL` state, the user can decide to create a test certificate by clicking the respective button in the UI.
This creates a snapshot of the current `c8y_certification_testRun` object and adds the `certificate` and `hashValue` fragments to create a `c8y_certification_testCertificate`.
This newly created object is immutable in the sense that all test results cannot be changed.

```json5
{
  type: 'c8y_certification_testCertificate', // set by MS: type of the manged object
  version: '1.0',
  hashValue: '2e400e60b947152aec082aadcc1d820a',
  product: {
    productName: 'BCM2708 000e',
    vendorName: 'Partner Company',
    deviceId: '9656728',
    parentId: '9656729'
  },
  certificate: {
    // set by MS: added information for certificate
    creationDate: '2021-08-10T05:54:38.107Z', // set by MS: date of certification
    c8yVersion: '1010.0.8', // set by MS: C8Y backend version at time of certification
    pdfDocument: 'https://t10452223.eu-latest.cumulocity.com/inventory/binaries/7101509', // set by MS: Links to the stored document in the blob storage
    status: {
      // set by MS: status of the certificate, see certificate life cycle
      code: 'VALID', // set by MS: overall test status
      text: 'Certification is valid', // set by MS: long text of overall test status
    }
  },
  tests: [
    {
      id: 'foundationModules',
      title: 'Foundation Modules',
      modules: [
        {
          id: 'deviceInformation',
          title: 'Device Information',
          mandatory: true, // true, false or obmitted (= false)
          status:{
            code: 'FAILED'
          },
          parts: [
            {
              id: 'deviceParts',
              title: 'device parts',
              mandatory: true, // true, false or obmitted (= false)
              status: { 
                code: 'FAILED'
              },
              capabilities: [
                {
                  id: 'c8y_IsDevice',
                  title: 'c8y_IsDevice',
                  mandatory: true,
                  status: { 
                    code: 'FAILED'
                  },
                },
              ]
            }
          ]
        },
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Life Cycle of a Test Certificate

The life cycle of a test certificate is captured in the `certificate.status` fragment. `certificate.status.code` can have the following values:

| Value     | Meaning                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `VALID`   | Certification is valid                 |
| `EXPIRED` | Certification has expired              |
| `REVOKED` | Certification was revoked by SAG admin |

Ones a certificate is created, it is set to `VALID` state.
A separate microservice compares the `certificate.creationDate` regulars against a set expiration duration and sets the state to `EXPIRED` if the expiration date is reached.
Additionally, an administrator can manually set the state to `REVOKED`, e.g. if a company leaves to partner program or incompliance is detected.

## Change log

- 2021-09-30
  - testSuit:
    - reverted to use arrays for tests, modules and capabilities to maintain their order. an update via put seems not to be required.
    - `mandatory` added to modules
  - testRun:
    - added `c8y_version`, `testSuit`-reference and overall `status` to root level

- 2021-10-15
  - removed the sentenace "The only modifiable fragment is `certificate.status`, to represent the certificates life cycle." Because this is not what we want and would leave to an admin the possibillity to change the status from "outside"


- 2021-10-27
  - added a new layer between modul and capability named part , to get more things in detail covered.
