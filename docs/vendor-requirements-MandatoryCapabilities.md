# Mandatory Capabilites for Vendor Device Certification

The device certification process requires the device to follow integration best practices.
This means that more fields are mandatory for a certified device compared to platform minium requirements.
In the following section, mandatory capabilities and behavior are described. The optional capabilities are part of a different document [Optional Capabilities for Vendor Device Certification](#https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-self-service-certification/blob/main/docs/vendor-requirements-OptionalCapabilities.md).

Information about one physical device is stored within multiple managed objects. Cumulocity IoT stores all general device information as one managed object in its inventory. The following json structure represents a typical managed object of a device in the inventory (`GET {{url}}/inventory/managedObjects/{{deviceId}}`):

```json5
"c8y_IsDevice": {},
"com_cumulocity_model_Agent": {},
"name": "edge-agent-eabdcf5d344b4a52a4ffab13fe3d11cb",
"type": "c8y_EdgeAgent",
"c8y_Agent": {
    "name": "DeviceAgent",
    "version": "1.0",
    "url": ""
},
"c8y_Firmware": {
    "name": "raspberrypi-bootloader",
    "version": "1.20140107-1",
    "url": "31aab9856861b1a587e2094690c2f6e272712cb1"
},
"c8y_Hardware": {
    "model": "BCM2708",
    "revision": "000e",
    "serialNumber": "00000000e2f5ad4d"
}
```
### Agent Information
The fragments `c8y_Agent` must be present in the device managed object stored in the inventory.

#### c8y_Agent

The device certificate will be issued for device defined by: `c8y_Hardware.model`, `c8y_Hardware.revision`, `c8y_Firmware.name`, `c8y_Firmware.version`, `c8y_Agent.name`, and `c8y_Agent.version`.

| Fragment  | Mandatory |
| --------- | --------- |
| `name`    | Yes       |
| `version` | Yes       |
| `url`     | No        |

Example structure in device inventory:

```json5
"c8y_Agent": {
    "name": "myCustomAgent",
    "version": "1.2.34",
    "url": "https//link-to-agent-repo.url"
}
```

### Device Information

The fragments `c8y_IsDevice`, `name`, `type`, `c8y_Firmware`, and `c8y_Hardware` must be present in the managed object of the device stored in the inventory. 

#### name

The Cumulocity IoT UI uses the device `name`.  `name` sets the name of the device used e.g. in 'all devices' and 'device info' views.

| Fragment | Mandatory |
| -------- | --------- |
| `name`   | Yes       |

Example structure in device inventory:

```json5
"name": "ExampleDeviceName"
```

#### c8y_IsDevice

`c8y_IsDevice` is an empty fragment that declares a Managed Object as a device.

| Fragment | Mandatory |
| -------- | --------- |
| `c8y_IsDevice`   | Yes       |

Example structure in device inventory:

```json5
"c8y_IsDevice": {} 
```

#### type

The fragment `type` can be interpreted as _device class_. Meaning, devices with the same `type` can receive the same types of configuration, software, firmware, and operations.
The Cumulocity IoT UI uses the device `type` often for filtering purposes like sending a software package to all devices of one specific `type`. Based on the device `type` Cumulocity can assign Dashboards to the same `type`.

| Fragment | Mandatory |
| -------- | --------- |
| `type`   | Yes       |

Example structure in device inventory:

```json5
"type": "c8y_EdgeAgent"
```

#### c8y_Hardware

The device certificate will be issued for device defined by: `c8y_Hardware.model`, `c8y_Hardware.revision`, `c8y_Firmware.name`, `c8y_Firmware.version`, `c8y_Agent.name`, and `c8y_Agent.version`.
These fragments will also be used in future versions of Device Partner Portal (display one "Device" entry in the overview device list per `c8y_Hardware.model` and a dropdown in the device detail view for each `c8y_Hardware.revision`).

| Fragment       | Meaning in Device Partner Portal                                        | Mandatory |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `model`        | Device in list view                                                     | Yes       |
| `revision`     | Dropdown inside device detail view to select device revision or version | Yes       |
| `serialNumber` | Not used in Device Partner Portal                                       | Yes       |

Example structure in device inventory:

```json5
"c8y_Hardware": {
    "model": "BCM2708",
    "revision": "000e",
    "serialNumber": "00000000e2f5ad4d"
}
```

#### c8y_Firmware

The device certificate will be issued for device defined by: `c8y_Hardware.model`, `c8y_Hardware.revision`, `c8y_Firmware.name`, `c8y_Firmware.version`, `c8y_Agent.name`, and `c8y_Agent.version`.

| Fragment  | Mandatory |
| --------- | --------- |
| `name`    | Yes       |
| `version` | Yes       |
| `url`     | No        |

Example structure in device inventory:

```json5
"c8y_Firmware": {
    "name": "raspberrypi-bootloader",
    "version": "1.20140107-1",
    "url": "31aab9856861b1a587e2094690c2f6e272712cb1"
}
```

### External ID

The External ID is displayed by the UI in the tab "Identity". The fragments `externalId` and `type` must be present in the managed object of the device stored in the inventory.

#### externalIds

For details and examples, compare [external id](https://cumulocity.com/api/10.10.0/#operation/postExternalIDCollectionResource) section of the documentation.

Used to identify the device in Cumulocity by its unique serial number, MAC, IMEI or similar unique identification string. If you don't want to specify a type, its recommend to use `c8y_Serial`.

| Fragment     | Mandatory |
| ------------ | --------- |
| `externalId` | Yes       |
| `type`       | Yes       |

Example structure in external id managed object (this information is stored in the identity managed object, not in the inventory managed object):

```json5
"externalIds": [
        {
            "externalId": "edge-agent-eabdcf5d344b4a52a4ffab13fe3d11cb",
            "type": "c8y_Serial"
        }
    ]
```

### Sending Operational Data

Sending measurements, events, and alarms are basic capabilities of any IoT enabled device. Therefore vendors should aim to support all three. However, there might be some instance where devices only send events (e.g. basic switches) or only measurements (e.g. basic sensor).
It is only mandatory to send either measurements, or events, or alarms in order to get certified while it is still recommended to implement all three capabilities.

| Functionality                     | Content                                          | Mandatory                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Measurements (M), Events (E), Alarms (A)| Information send from the device to the platform | Yes, at least one of the three |

#### Measurements

For details and examples, compare [measurements](https://cumulocity.com/api/10.10.0/#operation/postMeasurementCollectionResource) section of the documentation. It is only mandatory to send either measurements, or events, or alarms in order to get certified while it is still recommended to implement all three capabilities.

The device creates measurements with the following content:
| Fragment                    | Content                                                                                                    | Mandatory for Measurements |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `source`                    | Device ID                                                                                                  | Yes       |
| `type`                      | Type of measurement                                                                                        | Yes       |
| `time`                      | Date and time when the measurement was made                                                                | Yes       |
| Measurement Fragment        | The category of measurement                                                                                | Yes       |
| Measurement Fragment Series | The name of the measurement series. Contains at least the `value` fragment, optionally the `unit` fragment | Yes       |

 Measurement names should be written in camel-case. Cumulocity IoT UI inserts a blank space between a lower-case and an upper-case letter. Two or more consecutive upper-case letters are not separated with blank spaces. The UI also hides the prefix of a measurement name that is ending with a "_" (underline) symbol. 

Example POST body:

```json5
{
  "source": {
    "id": "251982",
  },
  "type": "c8y_TemperatureMeasurement",
  "time": "2021-10-19T12:03:27.845Z",
  "c8y_Steam": {
    // Measurement Fragment
    "Temperature": {
      // Measurement Fragment Series
      "unit": "C",
      "value": "100",
    },
  },
}
```

The _Measurement Fragment_ and _Measurement Fragment Series_ are used in the Cumulocity IoT UI in the following way:
![Measurement Fragment and Series in UI](./media/measurement-fragmentand-series-in-ui.png)


The following _Measurement Fragments_ are standard measurement fragments in Cumulocity IoT:
`c8y_AccelerationMeasurement`, `c8y_AccelerationSensor`, `c8y_Battery`, `c8y_CPUMeasurement`, `c8y_CurrentMeasurement`, `c8y_CurrentSensor`, `c8y_DistanceMeasurement`, `c8y_DistanceSensor`, `c8y_HumidityMeasurement`, `c8y_HumiditySensor`, `c8y_LightMeasurement`, `c8y_LightSensor`, `c8y_MeasurementPollFrequencyOperation`, `c8y_MeasurementRequestOperation`, `c8y_MemoryMeasurement`, `c8y_MotionMeasurement`, `c8y_MotionSensor`, `c8y_MoistureMeasurement`, `c8y_SignalStrength`, `c8y_SinglePhaseEnergyMeasurement`, `c8y_SinglePhaseEnergySensor`, `c8y_Steam`, `c8y_Temperature`, `c8y_TemperatureSensor`, `c8y_TemperatureMeasurement`, `c8y_ThreePhaseEnergyMeasurement`,`c8y_ThreePhaseElectricitySensor`, `c8y_VoltageMeasurement`,

#### Events

For details and examples, compare [events](https://cumulocity.com/api/10.10.0/#operation/postEventCollectionResource) section of the documentation. It is only mandatory to send either measurements, or events, or alarms in order to get certified while it is still recommended to implement all three capabilities.

The device creates events with the following content:
| Fragment | Content                                  | Mandatory for Events |
